    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Salad recipes are my favorite way to showcase vibrant, in-season produce – fruits and veggies that are so good on their own that you don’t need to do much to make them into a delicious meal. On cold winter nights, I like to brighten up our dinner table with a big, colorful mix of root veggies and hearty greens. On beautiful, warm days when I’d rather be outside than in the kitchen, summer salads are the perfect solution: they’re simple to toss together, but they’re totally delicious nonetheless.</p>
    <p>Whether you want to add more plant-based meals to your diet or are simply looking to change up your salad game, you’ll find tons of inspiration in the salad recipes below. With everything from green salads to pasta salads and beyond, these recipes are perfect for passing at potlucks, serving as dinner sides, and enjoying as full meals on their own.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cashew butter</li>
        <li>White miso paste</li>
        <li>Grated ginger</li>
        <li>Green cabbage</li>
        <li>Scallions</li>
        <li>Cilantro</li>
        <li>Basil</li>
        <li>Toasted peanuts</li>
        <li>Ripe peach</li>
        <li>Peppers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the cashew butter, miso paste, lime juice, sesame oil, and ginger. Whisk in enough water to create a drizzable consistency. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a dry cast-iron skillet over medium heat, char the peppers whole, rotating until the edges have a little char, about 2 minutes per side. Remove. When cool to the touch, slice in half lengthwise, remove the stem, ribbing, and seeds and slice horizontally into thin strips.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the cabbage, peppers, scallions, cilantro, basil, chiles, and ¾ of the dressing. Toss until combined. Add the remaining dressing, if desired, and season to taste with a few pinches of sea salt. Serve topped with the toasted nuts, seeds, and sliced peaches.</li>
    </ol>
